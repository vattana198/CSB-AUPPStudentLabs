"""
You are part of a team developing a new music streaming app called "MFun." Your task is to design the core functionality that manages the user's music library and playlist creation. Consider the following requirements:

Music library:
Needs to store a collection of songs and their associated metadata (title, artist, album, genre, length).
Must efficiently retrieve songs by various criteria (artist, album, genre, title).
Must prevent duplicate song entries.

Playlists:
Users can create unlimited playlists.
Each playlist can contain any number of songs, but a song cannot be added multiple times to the same playlist.
Songs can be added, removed, or reordered within playlists.
The app should display songs in the order they were added to the playlist.

Which data structure model(s) would you choose to implement the music library and playlist features? Explain your choices, considering the characteristics of each data structure and the specific requirements of the application.

Data structures to consider:
       Tuples, Sets, Lists, Dictionaries, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues
